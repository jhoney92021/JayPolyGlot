# Ruby Primitive Types

In Ruby, variables are dynamically typed, meaning that you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. However, Ruby has built-in data types that represent various kinds of values.

## Numeric Types

### 1. Integer Type

- **Integer:** Represents whole numbers.

### 2. Floating-Point Type

- **Float:** Represents floating-point numbers.

## String Type

- **String:** Represents sequences of characters.

## Symbol Type

- **Symbol:** Represents names and strings in an immutable form.

## Boolean Type

- **Boolean:** Represents boolean values (true or false).

## Special Types

- **nil:** Represents the absence of a value, similar to null in other languages.

## Example Usage:

```ruby
# Numeric types
age = 25
pi = 3.14

# String type
name = "John Doe"

# Symbol type
status = :active

# Boolean type
is_student = true
is_working = false

# Special type
nil_value = nil

puts "Age: #{age}"
puts "Name: #{name}"
puts "Status: #{status}"
puts "Is Student: #{is_student}"
```
