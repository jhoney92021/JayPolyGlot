# Python Primitive Types

In Python, primitive types are the basic building blocks for representing simple data values. Python has a dynamic typing system, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable.

## Numeric Types

### 1. Integer Types

- **int:** Represents integers.

### 2. Floating-Point Types

- **float:** Represents floating-point numbers.

## Complex Number Type

- **complex:** Represents complex numbers.

## String Type

- **str:** Represents strings.

## Boolean Type

- **bool:** Represents boolean values (True or False).

## Special Types

- **NoneType:** Represents the absence of a value, similar to null in other languages.

## Example Usage:

```python
# Numeric types
age = 25
pi = 3.14

# String type
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean type
is_student = True
is_working = False

# Special type
null_value = None

print(age)           # Output: 25
print(name)          # Output: John Doe
print(is_student)    # Output: True
print(null_value)    # Output: None
