## Adding to the PATH (Windows 11) ##
> This is an example of adding MYSYS2 to the PATH to make things like `gcc --version` available to CLI tools 
<br> The same process applies to dotnet or any other things you might want to add to the path 
<br> You can also add other helpful environment variables you might see this used on remote machines like servers 
<br> 
<br> Note: sometimes a reboot is required before a CLI will see new things on the PATH
