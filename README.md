## Intent ##
* The basic intent of this repo is to practice
    basic programming across language IE C#, Java, Ruby, etc
* Most things written should have some pairity in that
    it should be the same programs pretty much
    just with a different language/framework etc.

## Docs ##
* Each sub folder should have it's own README on how to open/run install blah blah blah
